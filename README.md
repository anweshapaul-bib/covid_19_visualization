COVID-19 dashboards mushroomed around the world in 2020 as data scientists and journalists shifted their work to tracking and presenting information on the pandemic â€” from infection and death rates, to vaccination data and other variables. Given the popularity and impact of the dashboard to date, I have made my own dashboard on the **Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Dataset** which mainly focuses on the change in covid cases over a time-span of three years (2020-2022) at both worldwide and country levels. Finally, the dashboard also demonstrates the vaccination status worldwide.
